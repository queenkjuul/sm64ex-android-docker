# SM64EX Android Port
This is fork of [VDavid003's port](https://github.com/VDavid003/sm64-port-android/tree/ex/nightly). My goal is to use this repo to fix a few issues and maybe add a few features.
## Building on an Android device
Use the helper script found here: [https://samutz.com/sm64/](https://samutz.com/sm64/)  
Or use the manual instructions found here: [Building Super Mario 64 on Android](https://samutz.com/docs/books/video-games/page/building-super-mario-64-on-android)

If you want to build SM64EX for Android on PC use [VDavid003's base repo](https://github.com/VDavid003/sm64-port-android-base) instead!
